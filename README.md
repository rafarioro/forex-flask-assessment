# forex-flask-assessment

did not use the API given on the instructions as it was down at the time of writing. 

I used currency converter 

and since this APIs documentation was not available I limited the currencies to a python list with 6 popular currencies as currencies = ["USD", "GBP", "EUR", "JPY", "AUD", "CAD"]
